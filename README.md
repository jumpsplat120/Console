# LOVE2D Console
 LOVE2D based console. Usable for anything you might want a console for; making a game about hacking, hooking it up using sockets for debugging, a text based adventure with LOVE2D capabilities, or whatever you can come up with.

## How to install
Using the console is really easy. Download the "console" folder, and place it in your project wherever you'd like. Then, in your code, require the "console.lua" file. Then you will want to add the following in your main.lua (I went with 'c' for my naming scheme, but you use whatever you'd like):

```lua
c = require "bin/console/console"

function love.load()
	c.load()
end

function love.update(dt)
	c.update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
	c.draw()
end

function love.wheelmoved(x, y)
	c.wheelmoved(x, y)
end
```

Simple!

## How to Use
The console will run any and all valid lua code. You can scroll with the scrollwheel on your mouse, or just click on the bar on the right hand side. You have the ability to execute code at the same time that code is being printed to the console, although they are not using seperate threads to do it, so if too many things are being printed to the screen, you may have trouble typing.

Pressing up or down will allow you to scroll through the history of things that you have already typed.

## Callbacks
There are a number of callbacks I put in to make a few things easy.

#####function c.print(str)
Your replacement for the standard "print" function. Use c.print() to print to the custom console specifically. While the argument is str, it will take most types and convert them. Valid argument types are: strings, numbers, nil, booleans, and tables. Tables use "inspect" to print tables in a human readable format.

#####function c.return(text)
Callback that can be used to modify input and output of the console. A usage example follows below
```lua
function c.return(text)
  if text == "hello" then
  return "Hello there"
  end
end
```
Returning a string will change the output in the console, and returning any string will prevent the input from being run as code. If you return a second string, then the seconded returned string will replace the userinput in the console. If you want to replace just the userinput, you can return nil for the first argument, and whatever you pass will be run as code instead of the userinput.

#####function c.clear()
Clears the console. Simple.

#####function c.setTextColor(color_or_R, G, B, A)
Will change the text color, as well as other colors that are linked to the text color. That includes the color of the scrollbar background, the cursor, and the color of the highlight when you ctrl-a.

#####function c.setBackgroundColor(color_or_R, G, B, A)
Will change the color of the background, as well as other colors linked to the background color. That includes the scrollbar itself, and the color of the text when it is being highlighted.

#####function c.reset()
If you bork everything, this will reset the console to the how it was in it's first state. Will most likely fix any problems you have if the console is being weird.

There are also a number of accessible variables, which are the following:
* c.textColor  = {1,1,1,1} //The direct variable for the textColor. You can change this instead of using the callback.
*	c.bgColor    = {.05,.05,.05,1} //The direct variable for the bgColor. You can change this instead of using the callback.
*	c.width      = 976 //This is the width of the console. Will be the same as the width from love.window.getModes()
*	c.height     = 480 //This is the width of the console. Will be the same as the height from love.window.getModes()
*	c.historyMax = 1000 //The max amount of history that will be saved. 
*	c.input      = "" //This is the variable that stores the string of whatever is being typed.
*	c.history    = {} //This is the table that contains all of the history. Items over the max will be deleted, first in, first out.
*	c.text       = {} //This is all the text that is being displayed on the screen.
*	c.flags      = {resizable = true, minwidth = 677, minheight = 343} //Flags that are set with love.window.setMode()
